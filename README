This is a simple script designed to read a Wiktionary XML dump file and import
definitions into Redis. It's not so robust right now, but you might use it as 
a base to scratch your own itch.

Usage:
wiktionary_to_redis.pl <wiktionary_dump_file.xml>

Make sure Redis (http://redis.io) is running first. 
Definitions are imported as a list with format <part of speech>:::<definition>.

After the import is finished, you can access definitions like this:

$ redis-cli
redis> LRANGE sink 0 -1
1. "noun:::A '''sink''' is a [[container]] for water to wash things in, usually with a [[drain]]."
2. "noun:::A '''sink''' is a [[device]] that [[remove]]s [[heat]] or [[energy]]."
3. "verb:::{{ti verb}} If something '''sinks''', it goes down, usually into water."

Spaces have been replaced with underscores (_):

redis> LRANGE Pacific_Ocean 0 -1
1. "proper_noun:::The '''Pacific Ocean''' is a very large [[body]] of water east of [[Asia]] and west of the [[America]]s."

Currently, it's only been tested to work with the Simple English site:

Wiki markup on other Wiktionary sites varies, so I can't guarantee it will work
for anything else.
